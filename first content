Hello everyone.
This is my blog.As a frist-year studint in CS.I started to write content for my blog, and through the beginning of this goal, I began to train my coding skills and English writing skills, my English is very poor, but my dream is to enter a foreign company like Google and Microsoft, so I can only force me to train in English.
Since this article is only the beginning and is not too long, I will explain other experiences about my experience of studying at CS in the next article.
Today is November 26, 2024 and I will continue to move towards my goal.
